    "# TiO₂ surfaces for water splitting — reproducible notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook contains (complete, reproducible workflow):**\n",
    "- Brief theory and *why* we choose specific surfaces for water splitting.\n",
    "- Code to fetch bulk TiO₂ structures from **Materials Project** (or fallback to local CIFs).\n",
    "- Code to build slabs for **rutile (110)** and **anatase (101)** and **anatase (001)**, relax them (placeholder) and save **POSCARs** for VASP.\n",
    "- Example `INCAR` and `KPOINTS` templates and suggestions for DFT parameters.\n",
    "- Extensive inline comments and Markdown explanations for every step — so you can follow and reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes before running:**\n",
    "- To download structures from Materials Project you need an API key. Place it in the environment variable `PMG_MAPI_KEY` or set `MP_API_KEY` variable in the notebook cells.\n",
    "- This notebook *does not* attempt to run VASP. It prepares structures and inputs. You should run DFT on your HPC cluster.\n",
    "- If you do not have a Materials Project API key, the notebook will show how to use local CIFs instead.\n"

    "## Why these surfaces? (short justification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rutile (110)** — *benchmark & surface science reference*\n",
    "- Rutile is the thermodynamically stable TiO₂ polymorph at bulk conditions. The (110) surface is the most commonly studied rutile facet in surface science because it is the most stable and well-characterized experimentally (STM, LEED, TPD, XPS).\n",
    "- For water splitting, rutile(110) is crucial as a **reference**: many mechanistic and adsorption studies use it as a baseline. If you want to compare to older experimental/theoretical literature, model this surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anatase (101)** — *practical photocatalysis standard*\n",
    "- Anatase nanoparticles commonly expose the (101) facet and are known to show strong photocatalytic performance (good charge separation). This facet tends to adsorb molecular water and is a representative \"realistic\" exposed facet of nanomaterials used in water splitting experiments.\n",
    "- Use anatase(101) when your goal is to model typical photocatalytic nanoparticles and overall water splitting activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anatase (001)** — *reactive facet, complementary study*\n",
    "- Anatase(001) is more reactive than (101) (higher surface energy), often implicated in oxidation reactions (OER). It's less stable but highly active — useful as a complementary surface to study high-activity sites for OER intermediates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical modelling note:** water splitting involves both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER). Often the **reduction** (HER) benefits from good electron transport (anatase or rutile), while **oxidation** (OER) is favored on higher-energy, more reactive facets (like anatase(001)). Therefore we include both anatase(101) and anatase(001) plus rutile(110) as a benchmark.\n"
